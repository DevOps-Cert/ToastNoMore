# MongoDB Notes

### 5 Factors to consider when embedding vs referencing
1. Requirements state that data from two or more entities are frequently queried together
2. The child is a dependent entity
3. There is a one-to-one relationship between two entities
4. Similar Volatility
5. If the entity you are considering embedding is not a key entity
