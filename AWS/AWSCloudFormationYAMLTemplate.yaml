AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "version date"
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-formats.html 

# OPTIONAL
# Specifies the AWS CloudFormation template version that the template conforms to. The template
# format version is not the same as the API or WSDL version. The template format version can
# change independently of the API and WSDL versions.

Description:
    # OPTIONAL STRING
    # A text string that describes the template. This section must always follow the template 
    # format version section.
    
Metadata:
    # OPTIONAL TEMPLATE METADATA
    # Objects that provide additional information about the templates
    
Parameters:
    #OPTIONAL SET OF PARAMETERS
    # Specifies values that you can pass in to your template at runtime (when you create or update a
    # stack). You can refer to parameters in the Resources and Outputs sections of the template
    
Mappings:
    # OPTIONAL SET OF MAPPINGS
    # A mapping of keys and associated values that you can use to specify conditional parameter 
    # values, similar to a lookup table. You can match a key to a corresponding value by using the 
    # Fn::FindInMap intrinsic function in the Resources and Outputs section.
    
Conditions:
    # OPTIONAL SET OF CONDITIONS
    # Defines conditions that control whether certain resources are created or whether certain 
    # resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you 
    # could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a production 
    # or test environment.
    
Transform:
    # OPTIONAL SET OF TRANSFORMS
    # For serverless applications (also referred to as Lambda-based applications), specifies the 
    # version of the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to use. When you specify a 
    # transform, you can use AWS SAM syntax to declare resources in your template. The model 
    # defines the syntax that you can use and how it is processed.
    
Resources:
    # REQUIRED SET OF RESOURCES
    # Specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud 
    # instance or an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket. You can refer to resources in the 
    # Resources and Outputs sections of the template.

Outputs:
    # OPTIONAL SET OF OUTPUTS
    # Describes the values that are returned whenever you view your stack's properties. For example, 
    # you can declare an output for an Amazon S3 bucket name and then call the aws cloudformation 
    # describe-stacks AWS CLI command to view the name.
