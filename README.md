# ToastNoMore

Toastbuster is no longer a unique handle on social media as other people have started using it so I have updated my username to ToastNoMore in the search of a universal unique identifier. Scientific research has also shown that Toast can contain carcinogens - so we should all be reducing our consumption of Toast. Or, at the very least, reducing the amount that we toast Toast. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/27/how-burnt-toast-became-linked-to-cancer-acrylamide
